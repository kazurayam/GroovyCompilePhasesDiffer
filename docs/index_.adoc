= Groovy Compile Phases Differ

The CompilePhasesDiffer accepts a *.groovy source.
It drives Groovy Compiler to generate Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for all CompilePhases and
decompiles the AST into human-readable *.groovy source files.
It also generates a "CompilePhasesDiff" report where you can see the unified-diffs of
the decompiled ASTs. With this report, you can see how Groovy Compiler process a *.groovy
source file to get a *.class file. You can see the progress with human-readable diff of ASTs.
